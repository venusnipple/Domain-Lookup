You can simply do DNS queries yourself. You would just have to always start at top (so called root servers) and work your way down the domain name, to be sure it does exist. Don't know what language you're using, but most languages out there have apropriate libraries for the job. Sure it requires some knowledge about DNS system itself, but since you are querying DNS system directly, you can be sure it is and will remain free.
